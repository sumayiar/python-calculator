Integrating my passion in math, I built a simple calculator in Python.

During the summer after high school, I built a study tool during my time at Google. Calculators are one way to aid a student's learning journey. 

Of course physical calculators are great. But, the introduction of software has forever changed the world.

I programmed this calculator to continue my programming journey by coding what I love, and one thing I love is math.

Hope you enjoy!
